A weather detector using Django is a web application that displays the current weather for various cities.In this project we use a weather API to fetch the data.The application would have a backend built using Django, which would handle the data processing and storage, and a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which would display the weather information to the user. The application would allow users to search for weather information for cities and return the necessary weather information for those cities
I developed this weather detector using Python Django framework. To see the this visi http://127.0.0.1:8000/
